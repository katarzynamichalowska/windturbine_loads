## Description

This project uses a CGAN to generate time-series data. It involves:
- Loading and preprocessing data.
- Training a generator and discriminator with specific loss functions.
- Saving model checkpoints and logs.
- Plotting the losses and generated samples during training.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    Create a virtual environment and install the required packages. You can use `requirements.txt` if available or install packages manually.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables (if needed):**

    Make sure to configure any environment variables or settings required by the project. Example configuration files might be provided.

## Usage

To train the CGAN, execute the training script:

```bash
python train_cgan.py
